# MECH_RTS_v0
Real time strategy made with A*. I was astonished as I found this project on Github over here and my big aim is to create an open source RTS game with unity. For now this is the very early development and I started it just a couple of days ago. My dream is to make a game like Command & Conquer 3 but for now this will take a lot of time.
